# Holiday

My first application built in in ASP.Net 6.0 to help businesses manage their employees holiday.

Current functionality V1:

User account creation, login, manage
Holiday entry creation with name, date range of holiday and cost
Holiday entry edit and delete
Holiday allocation and remaining balance calculation

Future features in V2:

UI overhaul with a calander view for current booked holidays
User roles added, allowing for holiday review and approval from manager
